# GoEco San Francisco

GoEco San Francisco is an interactive web application designed to raise awareness about the carbon footprint associated with different modes of transportation. By entering the distance traveled and selecting the mode of transportation, users can calculate and compare the carbon emissions they save by choosing more sustainable travel methods over driving a fuel car.

## Features

- **Emission Calculator**: Allows users to input the distance traveled and select a transportation method to see the CO2 emissions saved.
- **Interactive Lightbox**: Showcases a friendly character that motivates users to participate and contribute to a greener environment.
- **Social Media Integration**: Users can share their results and challenge friends on Twitter and Facebook to save emissions.
- **Leaderboard**: Displays a leaderboard of users who have saved the most emissions, encouraging a bit of friendly competition.

## How It Works

1. Enter your name and the distance you've traveled.
2. Choose your method of transportation from the available options: Fuel Car, Bike/Walk, Muni, and Bart.
3. Submit the form to see your CO2 emissions savings displayed.
4. Share your achievement on social media and see your rank on the leaderboard.
